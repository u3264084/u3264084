# Flight Delay Prediction

## Description
This repository contains the source code for a project that predicts flight delays based on various factors, such as historical flight data and weather conditions. The main goal of this project is to provide users with a tool that can analyze flight information and help predict whether a flight will be delayed, ultimately improving travel planning.


## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the Git command provided.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Change into the project directory that contains the cloned repository.

3. **Install the required packages**: Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary packages by using the requirements file included in the repository.

> **Note**: The data files are not included in this repository. Please ensure that you have the necessary datasets stored in the specified directory according to the requirements of the code.

## Usage
To run the code and make predictions about flight delays, follow these steps:

1. **Run the main script**: Execute the main Python script that drives the project.

2. **Input Data**: The program expects the relevant input data files to be located in the appropriate directories as specified in the code.

3. **Output**: Once the code is executed, the results will either be displayed in the console or saved to an output file, depending on how the code is structured.

## Expected Outcome
When you run the code, you can expect it to:
- Analyze the input flight data.
- Provide predictions on whether each flight will be delayed or not.
- Output performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, based on the model's evaluation.
